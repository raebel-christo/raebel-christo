## Hello programmers!

Hey guys, I am @raebel-christo, an undergraduate student at National Institute of Technology, Trichy. I love robotics and enjoy fiddling with electronics. I find it fun to play around with arduino, raspberry pi and nodeMCU. I recently opened this Github to post my projects that I wish to share with you all.

### What's my ambition?
Pursuing a career in robotics, especially in the domain of research oriented towards medical and assistive application is my goal.

## What is my skill set?
Oh currently I am quite good at:
- Programming in C/C++ and python
- Digital Painting
- Graphic Designing
- Video editing
- Sports, quite specifically, Athletics 400m

While those were my main skills, I can also do the following:
- 3D modelling and animation
- Music composition
- Photography
- Motion Graphics
- Some vague idea about game-dev
- Youtube

Some of the areas I like focusing on are:
- Machine learning
- Computer Vision
- Internet of Things
- Embedded
- ROS and Gazebo

I hope you find the projects I post over here inspiring and interesting to view! See you out there!
